# the-birds-battle
这只是一个小游戏并且这玩意只是在我有突发灵感的时候想出来的，我不想写代码因为我就是不想写。
This is just a little game and it was created when I have a sudden inspiration. I don't want to write its code because I don't want to write its code.

因为这个小游戏实际上是因为我在现实中和朋友一起用纸折鸟弄出来的，并且还设定了一个排位赛，所以借用一下这个存储库的页面来写我和朋友排行榜了，后面有想法再去写代码试着做一下。
Because this little game was actually created with paper folding birds by me and my friends in my life, and I also created a qualifying race in this gane, so I use this repository to write my and my friends' ranking list. I will try to write code to do it laaaaaater if I have any ideas.
