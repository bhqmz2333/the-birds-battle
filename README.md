# the-birds-battle
这只是一个我突发灵感想出来的小游戏，我还没有准备想去写代码。

This is just a little game and it was created when I have a sudden inspiration. I am not going to write its code.


因为这个小游戏实际上是因为我和朋友一起用纸折鸟然后想出来的，所以借用一下这个存储库的页面来写我和朋友的排行榜了，后面有想法再去写代码试着做一下游戏主文件。(o-o)

Because this little game was actually created with paper folding birds by me and my friends in my life, and I also created a qualifying race in this gane, so I use the GitHub Page of this repository to write my and my friends' ranking list. I will try to write code to do it laaaaaater if I have any ideas.
